# Fastai segmentation tile

Small library to add image tile support to fastai segmentation.
If you have a big image and you cannot run the segmentation model on it, this helps to divide the images in tiles run the model on each tile.

Initially developed for [Fruit detection on dryer](github.com/mone27/fruit-detection)
